The word computer comes from the word 'compute,' meaning to calculate [1]. Originally, a computer was considered a super-fast calculator [1]. Today, computers also accept, sort, select, move, and compare various types of information, performing arithmetic and logical operations [1]. The information given to a computer is called data [1]. Input data is the information presented to the computer [1]. After processing, the computer presents output data [2]. A computer program is a set of instructions for the computer to perform various operations [2]. Data processing is the conversion of input data to output with the help of a computer program [2]. A computer is a fast and accurate data processing system that accepts, stores, and processes data, and produces results based on instructions [2]. **Hardware** and **software** are terms often associated with computers [2]."

            "content": "Computers have evolved dramatically [3]. First-generation computers used **vacuum tube technology**, punched cards for input, and machine language for programming [4]. These computers were bulky, emitted heat, and had limited commercial use [4]. Charles Babbage is known as the 'father of modern digital computer' for inventing the analytical engine [5]. Early computers include the Mark I, the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC), the ENIAC, the EDVAC, and the UNIVAC I [5, 6]. The **ENIAC** was the first all-electronic computer [5]. The **EDVAC** was the first machine to use the stored program concept [6]. Second-generation computers used **transistors** [7]. The machine language was replaced by assembly language and high-level languages like COBOL and FORTRAN were developed [7]. The **stored program concept** allowed instructions to be held in memory and quickly modified or replaced [7]. Third-generation computers used **integrated circuits (ICs)**, which increased computation speed and reduced size and power consumption [7, 8]. Operating systems were designed to run multiple programs at once, known as multiprogramming [8]. Fourth-generation computers used **Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI)** and saw the introduction of **microcomputers** and **personal computers** [8]. Networking became common, with the Internet linking computers worldwide [9]. Fifth-generation computers are characterized by **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, like expert systems, and the ability to accept spoken words as input [9]."

Analog computers recognize data as a continuous measurement of a physical property [10]. Digital computers are high-speed programmable devices that process data through mathematical calculations, comparisons, and sorting [10]. They accept input and produce output as discrete signals representing high or low voltage states [10]. Digital computers are further classified as general-purpose or special-purpose [10]. They are also classified based on memory access and size [10]: Microcomputers (or personal computers) have the smallest memory and are used in daily applications [11]. Notebook and laptop computers are portable and battery-operated [11]. Handheld computers are smaller than notebook computers and used for field data collection [12]. Hybrid computers combine the speed of analog computers with the accuracy of digital computers, used in specialized applications [12]. Minicomputers are more powerful than microcomputers, used in process control systems [12]. Mainframe computers are very large and process data at high speeds, used in large organizations [12]. Supercomputers are the fastest, most powerful, and most expensive computers, using parallel processing for complex tasks [12]."

Sequential access devices, like magnetic tape, store data in a linear fashion and are read and written sequentially [41, 42]. Magnetic tapes are inexpensive and have high data density, but are sensitive to environmental conditions [43, 44]. Direct access storage devices, like magnetic disks, allow access to any data location without having to follow the sequence in which it was stored [44]. Magnetic disks can be hard disks or floppy disks, storing data on a magnetic coating divided into tracks [44, 45]. Optical cards and optical tapes are also available [46].
